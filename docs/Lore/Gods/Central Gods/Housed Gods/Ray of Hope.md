Born from the first dawn after the world's creation, Ray of Hope embodies the new beginning of every day. Constantly cheerful and optimistic, they bring warmth and comfort to all they touch. Radiating purity, they seek to instill hope and happiness in the hearts of the world's inhabitants, forever embodying the resilience of spirit and the joy of existence. This god is the embodiment of optimism, light, and joy. Worshipers are likely to be charitable, nurturing, and unwavering in their faith. They may often be found working in hospitals, orphanages, and places where comfort and hope are needed. This god may be seen as too naive or overly optimistic by gods such as the [Unfeeling Moon](Unfeeling%20Moon.md) or [Catastrophe](../Exiled%20Gods/Catastrophe.md). However, Ray of Hope would have a close kinship with the [Muse of Inspiration](Muse%20of%20Inspiration.md) and [True Teacher](True%20Teacher.md) due to their shared aspects of positivity and enlightenment.
