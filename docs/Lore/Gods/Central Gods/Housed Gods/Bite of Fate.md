Born from [the world](../../../../Places/The%20World.md)'s first brush with illness and the subsequent healing, Bite of Fate embodies the cycle of sickness and health. They are serious, compassionate, and pragmatic, acknowledging the harsh realities of life while also championing the power of medicine and healing. This god oversees both sides of the health coin: medicine and disease. Followers may be medical practitioners, alchemists, or herbalists. While [Ray of Hope](Ray%20of%20Hope.md) and Bite of Fate might work closely together in healing and comfort, Bite of Fate's acceptance of disease and death could strain the relationship.
