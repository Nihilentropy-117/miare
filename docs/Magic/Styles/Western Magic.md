Magic in the West Region is performed by offering one's magic to the spirits and gods of the world. The inhabitants see themselves as part of a greater whole, and their magic reflects this. They give their magic to their gods, who then perform the magic on their behalf. This reflects their belief in living in harmony with the world, respecting the balance of nature.

Their relations with other regions would be influenced by this communal, nature-oriented approach. The West might be seen as wise and harmonious, deeply in tune with the rhythms of the world. However, they might also be seen as passive or overly traditional, resistant to the changes brought about by the East's scientific progress or the Central Region's structured magical practices.
