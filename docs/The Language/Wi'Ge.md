## Grammar and Syntax Rules

Sentence Structure: The basic sentence structure follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. In other words, the subject comes first, followed by the verb and then the object.

Example: "I Te Be De" would mean "I am creating matter."

Tense Marker: Tenses are expressed by inserting the tense marker after the subject and before the verb.

Example: "I Ti Be De" translates to "I began creating matter."

Adjectives: Adjectives follow the noun they modify.

Example: "I Te Be De Gi" means "I am creating multiple matters."

Questions: Questions can be formed by beginning the sentence with the interrogative mood marker 'We'.

Example: "We U Te Be De" translates to "Are you creating matter?"

Imperatives: Commands can be formed by starting the sentence with the imperative mood marker 'Wi'.

Example: "Wi U Be De" translates to "Create matter!"

Negative Sentences: Negation can be expressed by adding 'Go' before the verb.

Example: "I Go Te Be De" translates to "I am not creating matter."

## Creating New Words

Word Formation: New words can be formed by combining different morphemes based on their meanings. For instance, "BeDe" could mean "Creator of Matter" by combining "Be" (To Begin/Initiate) and "De" (Matter).

Compound Words: Compound words can be formed by combining two or more words. For instance, "BeDeGi" can mean "Creator of Multiple Matters."

Word Modification: You can modify existing words to create new ones by adding prefix or suffix markers. For instance, you might decide that adding "Mi" in front of any noun amplifies its meaning. So, "MiDe" would mean "A lot of matter."

Remember, creating a language is a creative process. Feel free to adjust these rules as you see fit or as the language evolves. You might also want to think about how to express more complex ideas like conditionals (if, then statements), comparisons (better, worse, as good as), and more nuanced time aspects (had been running, will have been running, etc.).
