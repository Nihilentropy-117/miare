The land is primarily led by a king-like figure who is chosen by the people. They can appoint mayor candidates to each town but as long as the town can offer an alternative, they are never required to elect them. Though, there are rumours that being an alternative choice can be a dangerous decision but nobody can prove the rumours true. The large cities have major guilds for professions, casters, adventurers, hospitalities, and researchers. The mayor will normally meet with each of the guild leaders and the guards to determine the health of the city and what, if any, actions need to be taken. Depending on the side of the island (West or East), there will be reactions to races that do not exist on the nearby lands. While this land is between the two, they are still growing use to the races from lands that their ancestry did not descend. The more human-like races from both other continents are more easily accepted than ones that stick out. You may want to consider the reactions of commoners if you enter an unknown area as they may be tolerant at best of some races.
