In the West Region, gods are the spirits of the world. The inhabitants would likely live in harmony with nature, respecting its rhythms and seeking balance. Spirituality would be deeply woven into everyday life, with rituals and customs designed to honor the spirits of their surroundings.

Historically, this region might have developed a deep understanding of the natural world, leading to advancements in agriculture, medicine, and possibly a unique form of elemental magic. Its history would be characterized by a series of adaptations to the shifting moods of its natural gods.

Relations with other regions would likely be driven by a desire for balance and harmony. The West might serve as mediators in inter-regional conflicts, drawing on their inherent connection with the natural world and its cycles. However, they might also resist the rapid changes spurred by the East or the rigid dogmas of the Central Region, leading to friction.

The West (Wild Garden) supports many magical based species in high numbers such as: Elves, Magical Fairies, Pixies, Fey, Shifters, Gorgons, Dryads, Dragons, and Tieflings. Tradition is deeply rooted in the Wild Garden as many beings have very long lifespans and feel it’s not a question of if something can be done, but rather why something should be done. It doesn’t matter if a rock is rock because it can always be something else, so why does it need to not be a rock? They see the world as an ever changing slate that never stays the same. They see deities in a more shamanistic way: Appease the greater powers and you will receive power and protection.
