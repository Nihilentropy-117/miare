Magic has been systemized in this land in a way that makes it easy for even commoners to use basic spells to a degree. Their ability is limited to simple cantrips or low level spells though unless they dedicate themselves to arcane practice or have innate talent for it. However, while cantrips and low level spells are simple, they can still be dangerous. Due to the danger, a license is required for casting spells that are intended to hamper another beingâ€™s physical or mental state. Using hampering spells on an innocent non-license holder is grounds for immediate arrest and trial.
