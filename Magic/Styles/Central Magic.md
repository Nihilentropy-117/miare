Magic in the Central Region adheres to specific guidelines. Whether divine (granted by the gods) or arcane (drawn from the Prime Essence), all magic follows established rituals, incantations, or formulae. This ordered approach reflects their proximity to the gods and their belief in a structured cosmos. The inhabitants have a respectful, almost bureaucratic relationship with the divine, seeing magic as a right and a responsibility.

Their relations with the other regions might be influenced by this. The Central Region could be seen as the custodians of the "traditional" magical practices, and their organized approach could either be respected or seen as overly rigid. They might also serve as mediators between the East and West, having a balanced understanding of both internal and external sources of magic.
