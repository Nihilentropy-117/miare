The land is  home to several religious institutions, each dedicated to the numerous  gods who inhabit this realm, creating a deeply spiritual environment ideal  for those who seek order and structure.</p> <p>To the east of Miare, you will find the technologically advanced region of  Anehashi, governed by the Anehashi Alliance. Here, mortals and gods walk  side by side, with deities often embodying great figures who directly  influence the world. Magic in Anehashi is self-driven, requiring  practitioners to harness energy from within themselves to manipulate the  Prime Essence.

The Wild Garden is a place of deep respect  for the natural world and its cycles\u2014perfect for those who resonate with  nature and seek to understand its rhythms.</p> <p>Despite the stark contrasts, there is a sense of balance and harmony  across all regions.

This  interplay is reflected in the behaviors and roles of their followers,  creating a world of vibrant complexity where diversity of thought and  belief is not only tolerated, but celebrated.</p> <p>Miare is a world steeped in duality, where every light has its shadow, and  every creation its destruction.

Established centuries ago, the Unfeeling Knights have been trained to suppress their emotions entirely, allowing them to strictly adhere to the law without any personal bias or hesitation.</p> <p>Throughout history, the Unfeeling Knights have been known for their unwavering belief that magic should only be wielded for justifiable reasons. However, they do not involve themselves in domestic affairs unless there is a clear and visible violation of the law. In such cases, the local guards, who are trained to both help the people and enforce the law, are the ones to be approached for assistance.</p> <p>The presence of the Unfeeling Knights has been a subject of debate among various towns and cities across the realm. Some communities have chosen to ban the Unfeeling Knights from operating within their borders, while others have embraced them as their primary source of protection, forgoing the traditional guard training.</p> <p>One of the most distinctive features of the Unfeeling Knights is their unique armor, crafted from a rare metal known as Moonsteel. This metal is said to be forged from the very essence of the Unfeeling Moon, granting the Knights unparalleled strength and resilience. The armor is also imbued with powerful enchantments that help the wearer maintain their emotional detachment, further reinforcing their unyielding dedication to the law.</p> <p>The Unfeeling Knights have played a significant role in several major conflicts throughout history. During the Great Convergence, the Knights were instrumental in maintaining order and stability as the world transitioned from a unified land into the three distinct regions we know today. Their unwavering commitment to justice and their ability to remain impartial in the face of chaos made them invaluable allies to the various factions vying for power.</p> <p>In more recent times, the Unfeeling Knights have faced new challenges as the world continues to evolve. The rise of powerful magic users and the discovery of ancient relics have led to an increase in magical crime, forcing the Knights to adapt their methods and expand their ranks. Despite these challenges, the Unfeeling Knights remain a steadfast force for justice, dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring the safety of the realm.</p> <p>As theAs the world grows more complex and interconnected, the Unfeeling Knights have also begun to forge alliances with other organizations and factions. They have established a mutual understanding with the Eastern Region's magic users, who share their belief in the responsible use of magic. In the West Region, the Knights have found common ground with the Druidic Circles, who also value balance and harmony in the world.</p> <p>However, not all factions view the Unfeeling Knights favorably. Some groups, such as the Shadow Syndicate, see the Knights as a threat to their illicit activities and seek to undermine their authority. Others, like the Cult of the Unbound, view the Knights' strict adherence to the law as a form of oppression and actively work to dismantle their influence.</p> <p>In response to these growing threats, the Unfeeling Knights have established a secretive branch known as the Moon's Shadow. These elite operatives are tasked with infiltrating and dismantling criminal organizations and rogue factions from within, using their emotionless nature to blend in seamlessly and execute their missions with ruthless efficiency.</p> <p>As the world continues to change, the Unfeeling Knights stand as a symbol of unwavering dedication to justice and order. </p>"},{"location":"LOOK%20HERE/Suggested%20Articles/The%20Great%20Convergence/","title":"The Great Convergence","text":"<p>Long ago, the three regions - Central, East, and West - were once a single, unified land.

It fades based on the level of compliance and completion but will cause pain if further resistance occurs.</p>"},{"location":"Places/The%20World/","title":"The World","text":"<p>Firstly, we have the central region, Miare, the heart of our world. Here, the gods exist in a plane adjacent to our own, serving as constant companions to mortals. Miare is a place of tradition, where magic, whether divine or arcane, adheres to strict guidelines and rituals. When practicing magic here, think of it as a sacred dialogue with the gods, filled with respect and mutual understanding. Miare is home to diverse religious institutions dedicated to its various gods, making it a place of pilgrimage and profound theological exploration. If you seek structure and order, Miare welcomes you.</p> <p>To the east lies the technologically advanced region of Anehashi, governed by the Anehashi Alliance. Here, gods walk among mortals, embodying great figures who directly influence the world. Magic in Anehashi is self-driven; practitioners pull energy from their own strengths to manipulate the Prime Essence. The realm is known for its innovative spirit, where science and magic often intersect. It is a place for those who dare to push boundaries and forge their own destiny.</p> <p>Finally, venture to the west, and you'll find the Wild Garden, where gods embody the spirits of the world. Magic here is about unity and harmony, requiring practitioners to offer their own magic to the spirits, who then perform the magic in return. It's a place of deep respect for the natural world and the cycles of life. If you resonate with nature and seek to understand its rhythms, Wild Garden is the place for you.</p> <p>While these three regions may differ, all draw upon the Prime Essence, the life force, tying all beings and magic together. </p> <p>These gods suggest a world steeped in duality and balance, where every light has its shadow and every creation its destruction. It's a world filled with a vast array of cultures, with an intense appreciation for both the natural and supernatural, the material and immaterial. This is a place where the arts flourish as greatly as science and logic. It's a world of paradoxes and contradictions, a world of beauty and decay, wisdom and folly, courage and fear, love and hatred.</p> <p>Despite the stark contrasts, there is a sense of harmony. No god completely overshadows another; instead, they seem to work in a complex interplay, sometimes in alliance, sometimes in opposition. The gods' followers reflect this, their behaviors and roles serving as microcosms of the gods' diverse domains. From this, we can infer a world of vibrant complexity, where diversity of thought and belief is more than just tolerated\u2014it's the norm.</p>"},{"location":"Places/The%20Central%20Region/The%20Central%20Region/","title":"The Central Region","text":"<p>The Central Region, Miare, the Island of the Crab, is characterized by its divine adjacency. The inhabitants live alongside their gods, who are experienced as distinct, interactive beings in an adjacent plane. The people here are likely to have established robust religious institutions dedicated to individual deities, leading to diverse religious practices and beliefs within the region.</p> <p>Historically, the Central Region might have been the seat of major theological developments and the birthplace of organized religion. Its inhabitants might be considered the keepers of divine law, making it a place of pilgrimage for people from the other regions.</p> <p>Relations with the other regions would depend heavily on religious diplomacy. Given the perceived proximity of their gods, the Central Region could view themselves as intermediaries between the divine and the mortal, guiding religious practices across the world. This could lead to either a sense of spiritual superiority or a commitment to religious service.</p> <p>Miare, the Central Region, has a mix between the feelings of east and West but revolves around compromise. In regards to how the differences between religious views falls? There are some mild spats here and there but the laws are very clear on it. Do not discriminate based on beliefs. As you can have your own, you must allow others to have theirs.

This would lead to a society that greatly values individual achievement and merit. The inhabitants would likely hold heroes, leaders, and innovators in high regard, seeing them as divine or semi-divine figures.</p> <p>Historically, this region would have seen periods of rapid development, led by these god-figures. It might be known for its advances in arts, sciences, and governance. Its history would be filled with legendary figures and great deeds that continue to shape the present.</p> <p>Relations with the other regions would be largely influenced by their active gods. The East might often take the role of innovators or leaders in inter-regional matters, guided by the tangible examples of their divine figures. However, this active divine intervention might also lead to hubris and overreach, causing tension with the other regions.</p> <p>The East (Anehashi) supports many humanoid based races in high numbers such as: Humans, Giants, Warforged, Dwarves, Energy Fairies (Rarely), Halflings, and many races that blend human with beast features (Dragonborn, Tabaxi, Kenku, Leonin, and so on). Knowledge, practice, and research is the view of the East. Build upon those who came before you but do not be bound by it. What worked today, might not work tomorrow, but there\u2019s a reason behind it. It\u2019s less about the why and more about the how. A rock is a rock because that is the makeup of the object. If you make a hammer out of the rock, it\u2019s now a hammer, not a rock. They see the world as a solid foundation that can be built upon. They feel they shouldn\u2019t rely on the gods power and they should find power and protection within themselves and their actions. They have a reserved respect to the gods: Utterances of protection before a journey are more common than praying for a god to save someone or give them strength.</p>"},{"location":"Places/The%20Western%20Region/The%20Western%20Region/","title":"The Western Region","text":"<p>In the West Region, gods are the spirits of the world.

Its history would be characterized by a series of adaptations to the shifting moods of its natural gods.</p> <p>Relations with other regions would likely be driven by a desire for balance and harmony. The West might serve as mediators in inter-regional conflicts, drawing on their inherent connection with the natural world and its cycles. However, they might also resist the rapid changes spurred by the East or the rigid dogmas of the Central Region, leading to friction.</p> <p>The West (Wild Garden) supports many magical based species in high numbers such as: Elves, Magical Fairies, Pixies, Fey, Shifters, Gorgons, Dryads, Dragons, and Tieflings. Tradition is deeply rooted in the Wild Garden as many beings have very long lifespans and feel it\u2019s not a question of if something can be done, but rather why something should be done. It doesn\u2019t matter if a rock is rock because it can always be something else, so why does it need to not be a rock? They see the world as an ever changing slate that never stays the same.

The large cities have major guilds for professions, casters, adventurers, hospitalities, and researchers. The mayor will normally meet with each of the guild leaders and the guards to determine the health of the city and what, if any, actions need to be taken. Depending on the side of the island (West or East), there will be reactions to races that do not exist on the nearby lands. While this land is between the two, they are still growing use to the races from lands that their ancestry did not descend.
