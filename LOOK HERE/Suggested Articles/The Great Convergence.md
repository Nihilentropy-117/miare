Long ago, the three regions - Central, East, and West - were once a single, unified land. The gods and mortals lived in harmony, and magic flowed freely through the world. However, as time passed, the inhabitants began to develop distinct beliefs and practices, leading to the formation of the three distinct regions we know today.

The Central Region, with its adjacent plane for the gods, became a place where the gods were revered and respected, but remained separate from the mortal realm. The Housed, Neutral, and Exiled Gods each played their roles in shaping the values and taboos of society.

In the East Region, the gods chose to walk among mortals, taking on larger-than-life forms to directly influence and inspire the world. Eastern Magic focused on individual achievement and the understanding of natural laws, leading to a progressive and innovative society.

The West Region, on the other hand, saw the gods as spirits of the natural world, with mortals offering their magic to these gods in exchange for their blessings. Western Magic emphasized harmony and balance, reflecting the inhabitants' belief in living as part of nature.
