Formed from the cold logic of the universe, Unfeeling Moon is the embodiment of order and reason. They are stoic, methodical, and rational, striving to understand the universe through the lens of science and logic. They guide the world towards order and stability, even as they represent the inevitability of death and the stark beauty of winter. The embodiment of logic, order, and death. This god's followers would be pragmatic, rational, and potentially aloof, and may excel as scientists, philosophers, and doctors. Unfeeling Moon may find a natural ally in the [Guardian of Secrets](Guardian%20of%20Secrets.md) and the True Teacher, sharing a reverence for knowledge and understanding. Their emotionless nature may cause friction with the [Ray of Hope](Ray%20of%20Hope.md) and the [Muse of Inspiration](Muse%20of%20Inspiration.md). true followers of the Unfeeling Moon would absolutely not care in the slightest what the Immortal Dragons care about. It is about balance, no matter the cost. True neutral. If a fight is to break out, it would go against both deities as they seek to keep the world safe.
