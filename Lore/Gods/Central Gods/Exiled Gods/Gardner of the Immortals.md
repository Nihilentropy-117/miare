Born from [the world](../../../../Places/The%20World.md)'s first harvest, Gardner of the Immortals represents growth and cycles. They are nurturing, patient, and wise, overseeing the natural cycles of the world. Despite their exile, they continue to foster growth, quietly guiding the world through the ebb and flow of seasons. This god represents natural cycles and growth. Its followers may be farmers, herbalists, or environmentalists. Despite its exile, it could potentially have a good relationship with gods like [Ray of Hope](../Housed%20Gods/Ray%20of%20Hope.md) and [Muse of Inspiration](../Housed%20Gods/Muse%20of%20Inspiration.md) due to shared aspects of growth and life.

The Gardner of the Immortals tends to primarily the Heavenly Garden where all manner of unique plants grow. The Gardner also tends to bring good fortune to farmers or those who restore nature or help it thrive, while seeing normal mortals as a weed that needs to be removed. They don't directly cause the plants to grow, but they definitely can bring great harvest for those who are proven.
